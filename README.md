# Task-6-To-Do-Application-using-Java-GUI

# Java Swing To-Do App

Company: Elevate Labs

Type: Internship Project

Objective: Build a Java GUI To-Do List with persistence, editing, priorities, and deadlines, following loose coupling and MVC principles.

**Features**

-> Add Tasks with priority level and deadline.

-> Edit Tasks â€“ modify existing tasks in place.

-> Delete Tasks â€“ remove selected tasks.

-> Priority Levels â€“ color-coded:

  ðŸŸ¢ Low

  ðŸŸ  Medium

  ðŸ”´ High

-> Deadlines â€“ select due dates with a date picker (JSpinner).

-> Data Persistence â€“ tasks are saved in tasks.txt automatically.

-> MVC Architecture â€“ clean separation of Model, View, and Controller for maintainability.

**Tools & Technologies**

-> Java SE

-> Java Swing (built-in GUI library)

-> IntelliJ IDEA 

**Project Structure**

   src/
   
    â”œâ”€â”€ model/
    
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Task.java
    
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ TaskManager.java
    
    â”œâ”€â”€ view/
    
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ToDoAppView.java
    
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ PriorityCellRenderer.java
    
    â”œâ”€â”€ controller/
    
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ToDoAppController.java
    
    â””â”€â”€ Main.java
    
    â””â”€â”€ tasks.txt

    
**How It Works**

1. Main.java :- Launches the application.

2. Instantiates the TaskManager (Model), ToDoAppView (View), and ToDoAppController (Controller).

3. Model (model package)

      -> Task â†’ Represents a task with priority, description, and due date.

      -> TaskManager â†’ Handles adding, editing, deleting, loading, and saving tasks to tasks.txt.

4. View (view package)

      -> ToDoAppView â†’ Builds the GUI components.

      -> PriorityCellRenderer â†’ Colors tasks based on their priority.

5. Controller (controller package)

      -> ToDoAppController â†’ Handles all event listeners, updates model data, and refreshes the view.

6. Data Persistence
      -> Tasks are stored in a local file: tasks.txt.

On startup, the app automatically loads tasks from this file.

When tasks are added, edited, or deleted â†’ file is updated instantly.
